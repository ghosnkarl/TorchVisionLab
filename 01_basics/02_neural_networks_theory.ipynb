        "\n",
        "- **Computer programs that learn from examples**\n",
        "- No need to write explicit rules - they figure out patterns automatically\n",
        "- Work like humans learning: see examples → find patterns → make predictions → learn from mistakes\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. The Structure (3 Main Parts)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input Layer:** Where data enters (one neuron per feature)\n",
        "- **Hidden Layer(s):** Where processing and pattern recognition happens\n",
        "- **Output Layer:** Where the final prediction comes out\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. The Forward Pass (Making Predictions)\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "For each neuron:\n",
        "1. Multiply inputs by weights\n",
        "2. Add them up\n",
        "3. Add a bias\n",
        "4. Apply activation function (like ReLU)\n",

        "Result: A prediction!\n",

        "#### 4. Activation Functions (Why We Need Them)\n",

        "- **Without them:** Can only learn straight lines (limited!)\n",
        "- **With them:** Can learn any complex pattern\n",
        "- **ReLU:** Most common - keeps positive values, zeros negative values\n",

        "- **Backpropagation:** Working backwards through the network to calculate gradients\n",

        "- **Updates all weights to make network better**\n",
